    <h2>Urban Forestry</h2>
    <p>

        We believe urban forestry can be a good partial solution to the growing climate problems.
        Urban forestry is the care and management of single trees and tree populations in urban settings for the 
        purpose of improving the urban environment. Urban forestry involves both planning and management, 
        including the programming of care and maintenance operations of the urban forest. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Urban forestry advocates the role of trees as a critical part of the urban infrastructure. 
        Urban foresters plant and maintain trees, support appropriate tree and forest preservation, 
        conduct research and promote the many benefits trees provide. Urban forestry is practiced by municipal and commercial arborists, 
        municipal and utility foresters, environmental policymakers, city planners, consultants, educators, researchers and community 
        activists.

    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>
        Urban forests mitigate the effects of urban heat island through evapotranspiration and the shading of streets and buildings. 
        This improves human comfort, reduces the risk of heat stroke and decreases costs to cool buildings.<br>
        <br>
        Urban forests improve air quality by absorbing pollutants such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia, and particulate matter as 
        well as performing carbon sequestration. Urban forestry can be an important tool for stormwater management as trees absorb 
        and store rainwater through the canopy, and slow down and filter runoff with their roots. Other benefits include noise control, 
        traffic control, and glare and reflection control.<br>
        <br>
        
        A 2018 study asked low income residents of Philadelphia "how often they felt nervous, hopeless, restless, depressed and 
        worthless." As an experimental mental health intervention, trash was removed from vacant lots. Some of the vacant lots 
        were "greened", with plantings of trees, grass, and small fences. <br> Residents near the "greened" lots who had incomes below the 
        poverty line reported a decrease in feelings of depression of 68%, while residents with incomes above the poverty line 
        reported a decrease of 41%. Removing trash from vacant lots without installing landscaping did not have an observable 
        mental health impact.

<section id="practice">
    <h2>Practice</h2>
    <p>
        Urban forestry is a practical discipline, which includes tree planting, care, and protection, and the overall management of 
        trees as a collective resource. The urban environment can present many arboricultural challenges such as limited root and canopy space, 
        poor soil quality, deficiency or excess of water and light, heat, pollution, mechanical and chemical damage to trees, and mitigation of 
        tree-related hazards. Among those hazards are mostly non-immediate risks like the probability that individual trees will not withstand strong 
        winds (as during a thunderstorm) and damage parking cars or injure passing pedestrians.<br>
        <br>
        
        Management challenges for urban forestry include maintaining a tree and planting site inventory, quantifying and maximizing the benefits of trees, 
        minimizing costs, obtaining and maintaining public support and funding, and establishing laws and policies for trees on public and on private land. 
        Urban forestry presents many social issues that require addressing to allow urban forestry to be seen by the many as an advantage rather than a 
        curse on their environment.
